Which is the most appropriate 
a vector
a deque
or a list 
for the following program tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice If there is no reason to prefer one or another container explain why not

(a) Read a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container alphabetically as they are entered.
Inserting alphabetically requires inserting anywhere in the container, not just at front/back. Best choice would be a list.

(b) Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the back. Remove the next value from the front.
A deque. Fast adding of elements on the back and also fast removal at the front. 

(c) Read an unkown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and then print them to standard output.
A vector. We just push back elements until we are done. Sorting comes afterwards.
