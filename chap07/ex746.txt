(a) A class must provide at least one constructor.

Not true, a class must provide at least one constructor in the case that has objects of class type that cannot be default initialized. 
Otherwise the synthesized default constructor of the compiler will do the trick for us

===========

(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.

Not necessarily. It may be that a constructor has only default parameters. Would still work if invoked with no arguments or in cases 
where you have statements like T obj; where T is the type and obj the variable name.

===========

(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not provide a default constructor.

True. To prohibit unwanted scenarios of invalid values it is best to not have a default constructor. The object should be initialized
 and used as the class architect intended to do so.

===========

(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated type

Not true. the compiler-synthesized default constructor performs default initialization of members: class-type members are default-constructed only if their classes
have accessible default constructors; otherwise, synthesis fails. Built-in types are default-initialized to indeterminate (garbage) values if they have no in-class
initializer.
